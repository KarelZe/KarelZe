### Hi there I'm @KarelZe (Markus Bilz)👋

I'm passionate about machine learning and quantitative finance. I like to write readable and performant code.🚀

At the moment, I'm primarily focused on developing fraud-detection solutions at [Atruvia](https://atruvia.de/). I'm also pursuing a master's degree at KIT. You can find most of my projects listed on [edu.markusbilz.com](https://edu.markusbilz.com/).
