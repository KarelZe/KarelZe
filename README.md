### Hi there I'm @KarelZe (Markus Bilz)👋

I'm passionate about machine learning and deep learning, currently focusing on vision-language models and synthetic data generation. My goal is always readable, performant code.🚀

After graduating from KIT, I joined Atruvia to develop document AI solutions.
